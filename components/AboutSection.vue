				<h1>Kristin Erickson</h1>
				<p>Kristin Erickson, currently based in Salt Lake City, decided she wanted to be a folk singer when she was eight years old. Growing up in Minnesota, Kristin was raised on music: church choir, Broadway show tunes, classical, country, and was blessed with piano lessons, and school band with clarinet and oboe. But it was the music of the '60's that really captured her attention and her heart.</p>
				<p>Kristin left school in her mid-teens to pursue her music full-time. She performed for many years, based in Minneapolis, throughout the upper Midwest in coffeehouses, college concerts, bars, television, radio, recording studios, bowling alleys, wherever she could get hired to play. Most of her performances were solo, just her voice and acoustic guitar, although she did put in a year with Minnesota country legends, The Sky Blue Water Boys. High points from those early days included opening sets for Tom Rush, Wendy Waldman, and Odetta.</p>
				<p>	Then came a twenty-year break for college, law school, marriage and children. Thankfully, Kristin has returned to singing, playing, and writing with greater passion than ever. She believes the greatest gift she can give her children is a life fully lived, and that is what she is aiming for. Her performances these days consist primarily of her original songs, but also include songs of talented friends she has had the pleasure of knowing through the years and a few choice covers from artists like Patti Griffin, Joni Mitchell and Tom Waits.</p>
